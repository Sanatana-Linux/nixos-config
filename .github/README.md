## Documentation


<img width="150px" height="150px"  src="./assets/nix.svg" alt="prettier nixos label" align="right" />

All of the documentation is in the [.github/documentation](./.github/documentation) directory, which serves as a project-specific notebook of sorts for convenient reference. The contents are as follows:

1. [Installation Notes](.github/documentation/installation.md) - Personal reference notes for installation
1. [Useful Nix Commands](.github/documentation/nix-commands.md) - A cheatsheet that informs my nix wrapper script
1. [Inspiration and Credits](.github/documentation/credits.md) - Those giants we give shoulder aches to standing upon
1. [Debugging Journal](.github/documentation/errors.md) - A sometimes kept up log of issues I run into and my hacky workarounds and/or fixes to solve them.
