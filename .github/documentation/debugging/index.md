# Debugging Journal

This is the index of notes relating to issues that have arisen since I began keeping these notes and remembered to add new issues to them (which I am not always very good about remembering tbh).

Hopefully, these notes can help others in similar positions or at least provide a rough outline of problem solving the `NixOS` way. If nothing else, they keep me from lapsing again into the same problems, which is enough of a reason to make them itself.
