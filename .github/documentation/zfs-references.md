# ZFS References

Considering using ZFS, so here are some references from my cursory research on the topic that may be helpful if I do: - [NixOS Root on ZFS](https://openzfs.github.io/openzfs-docs/Getting Started/NixOS/Root on ZFS.html) - [OpenZFS NixOS Getting Startedz](https://openzfs.github.io/openzfs-docs/Getting%20Started/NixOS/) - [NixOS Wiki: ZFS](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/ZFS#Simple_NixOS_ZFS_installation) - [Encrypted ZFS mirror with mirrored boot on NixOS](https://elis.nu/blog/2019/08/encrypted-zfs-mirror-with-mirrored-boot-on-nixos/)

**Thinking on Matter at Present:** Long term, will be the way to go. Especially if, God willing,
I am ever able to build my own NAS server and have disks larger than 16TB. First, however, I should
work out using LVM as the filesystem for root and getting encryption to work.
