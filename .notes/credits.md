# Credit Where It's Due

This configuration, like many others, owes a huge debt of gratitude to other configurations that have inspired it and provided many snippets, organizational patterns and epiphanies when rummaged through mercilessly like I hope others do to this flying spaghetti code monster in the future. Here's some of those that provided as much, to the authors of which I am deeply grateful for their hard effort.
