# DevOS Refactoring 

These items reflect a transition towards a configuration more in line with that of the [DevOS](https://github.com/divnix/digga/tree/main/examples/devos) model of NixOS configurations that is now housed as an example configuration within the [digga](https://github.com/divnix/digga) repository. I like elements of that configuration a lot, thus seek to incorporate them locally. 


## To-Dos
- [ ] move devshell components into repo and integrate them 
  - [ ] including setting up templates for dev environments by language 
    - [ ] locate examples of such to base this upon or give ideas at least 

- [ ] treefmt add-in
