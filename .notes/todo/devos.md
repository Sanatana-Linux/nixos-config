# DevOS Refactoring 

These items reflect a transition towards a configuration more in line with that of the [DevOS](https://github.com/divnix/digga/tree/main/examples/devos) model of NixOS configurations that is now housed as an example configuration within the [digga](https://github.com/divnix/digga) repository. I like elements of that configuration a lot, thus seek to incorporate them locally. 


## To-Dos
- [x] rename modules to settings to reflect the common parlance of nixos configurations it seems (modules are used for settings options that are being added in I guess. Not that it matters much as the whole lexicon is in a flux it seems and its just as well to call it purple moose crap and its purpose/function is unchanged)

- [ ] treefmt add-in
