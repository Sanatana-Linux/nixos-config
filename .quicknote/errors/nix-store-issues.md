# Error or Issue Template 

- **Date:** June 15, 2023  
- **Error or Issue Name:** Nix-Store NarHash Corruption Conundrum 
- **Notes on Mitigation Efforts**
  - After attempting to install a pkg from a specific NUR repo, a narhash went corrupt thus preventing rebuild 
 	 - attempts to clean the store, delete the various caches and optimize the store manually all failed  
  - So I packaged up the vital files and dropped them on Dropbox, in preparation for the present reinstallation 

 
- **Solution or Verdict:** *(TENATIVE)* Reinstallation since none of the mitigation efforts were working, seemed best to start fresh and be done with the issue.
