# Notes Index

## Introduction

---

In a compromise with myself and realization of a need to keep project specific notes with the project itself, I have opted to include `.notes` directories with notes included in projects as needed in addition to my central note-taking location that I use [Notion.so](https://notion.so) to manage.

The notes contained in this `.notes` directory are related to the overarching NixOS configuration core to the Sanatana Linux project.
