> Personally, I like to put a single song on repeat for hours and hours, days even. It helps me zone in. Why does this admittedly strange behavior help me? I'm not sure exactly, but I've known it to be helpful for more than half my life. I like to get up early before the family is awake, close Slack, put my phone in Do Not Disturb mode, and work. I even put a Post-it note on my monitor with the task I'm focusing on to help keep me on track. Sometimes I can accomplish more in that quiet hour and a half than I can in the rest of the day.

A few notes on this quote: - ADHD is a challenge to deal with, everyone's strategies differ and are idiosyncratic. There
need not always be an explanation for why something helps, so long as it does that is excellent
and sharing one's strategies in public is often the inspiration for others to find their own.
This author sharing his is something we all should be thankful for, suffering from ADHD or not. - As I am also slowly accumulating knowledge of Sanskrit, which may or may not lead to me
pursuing an advanced degree related to it or the study of Hinduism in the future, I have found
using mantras set to music in the background to be an extremely helpful way to maintain my focus on the task
at hand while also picking up the pronunciation of the language and deepening my knowledge of
specific terms at the same time. I have found one YouTube channel in particular, Chant Central,
that has especially good renditions of various mantras from Shaktist tantras that for me are
particularly useful given the association of such with the Trika Shaivism that has captivated my
interest most deeply. This is a highly specific thing to listen to repetitively but I find that
mantras impart a better vibrational energy when replayed than most contemporary music tends to
and is less prone to evoking unpleasant moods that tend to stifle one's productivity. - I have also used successfully music in languages I do not know, nor intend to deepen my
knowledge of, as a means of accomplishing much the same. I especially enjoy the soundscape
of African music for this purpose, **soukous** in particular and most especially the music
of Diblo Dibala, are especially beautiful examples of the interesting and innovative ways in
which African (in this case Congolese) musicians utilize instruments and sounds to craft
beautiful emotional tapestries expressive of deep and complex aspects of the human condition
that need not be the depressive or ruminative pity parties that music in the West of
comparable quality tends to become. Russian traditional marches are also good for this, as
they are the uplifting and even exciting tunes that armies marching would be singing that
retain some degree of awareness of their context in theme (if you look up the translations)
