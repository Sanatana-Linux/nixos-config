# Hate Me and Down Vote Me All You Want, But I Won't Stand For Trivializing the Tens of Millions That Died Due to These Half-Baked Ideals

Its cute that people are adapting to the police state by fetishizing 20th century police states on the far left and far right but these are not arbitrary or insignificant aesthetic preferences.

Academics doing mental gymnastics still at least the 1/4th of Cambodia that were killed by the Khmer Rogue (a communism party in power for 4 years in the late 70s), who were overwhelmingly themselves laborers all the same, shouldn't be so trivialized for your taste in militaristic fashion (which being that you are likely like most others drawn to this imagery and drawn to tech no less, from the petty bourgeois yourself and are most likely merely deflecting from what is actually a love of the aesthetics pf National Socialism you cannot admit to yourself, driving you to need to virtue signal atwith this drivel to stave off that demon but this is no more virtuous). Think of the people that before they were killed watched soldiers throw their babies at trees thus killing the child and as they cried out a round from an AK-47 entered their skulls and the soldiers harvested their adrenal glands to get high while killing the next batch. (

Not to mention the nightmare that happened in Russia at the behest of that man depicted in bust on your relatively kitsch wallpaper. Or the obscene numbers that died in the Cultural Revolution in China that also robbed humanity of numerous cultural treasures deemed "backwards" by homicidal maniacs.

# Its not cool to trivialize the victims of 20th century authoritarianism, period

PS The success of open source has been more of a boon to capitalism and proven the vacancy merely in the US administration of intellectual property laws enforced by heavy handed courts with judges protecting their investments and the wealthy. That **says nothing about a need or the ascendency or legitimacy of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat** aka a system of enforced economic socialism leading "naturally" to a society which magically would not need a government to administer its economy once workers had the means of production. That's all sophistry for a group to con those assuming earnestness in others to seize power and do away with the elements of society that limit their power (the wealthy and the religious leadership that once in the West commanded a sort of spiritual and narrative power). US Patent Law and the use of sanctions or other soft power to abusively enforce it internationally being as bad an idea in practice as it is on paper doesn't add validity to what you unimaginatively think its opposite in that false dichotomy. Dualism is almost always only an illusion due to the quirk of human perspective, thus only systems entirely derived from us are truly binary (machine language is a great example) the rest of the universe is not so constrained,
